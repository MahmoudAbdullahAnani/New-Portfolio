Fluent-React is a JavaScript library designed to work seamlessly with React applications to handle internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n). Built on Mozilla’s Fluent localization system, Fluent-React enables developers to create adaptable user interfaces by separating translation logic from the application’s business logic.

## Key features include:

1. Declarative Syntax: Use intuitive, fluent syntax that keeps translation files readable for both developers and translators.
2. Dynamic Translations: Supports advanced localization features such as gendered text, pluralization, and complex nested structures.
3. React Integration: Fluent-React provides React components like "Localized" to easily inject translations into your UI components.
4. Context-Aware Localization: Adjusts translations dynamically based on user input, data changes, or different application contexts.
5. Performance Optimized: Designed to ensure that translations are rendered efficiently, without affecting the overall performance of your React application.

Whether you're building multilingual applications or enhancing user experience through localized content, Fluent-React offers the flexibility and control to manage complex internationalization scenarios effortlessly in React environments.
